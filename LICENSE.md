To make a warranty claim, the User must contact Production Systems SAS at the email address indicated in Article 14.6 of this agreement, with sufficient information to enable confirmation of the date of effectiveness of this License Agreement, which the User acknowledges and accepts.

### 8.4 Obligation of means

Bearing in mind the highly technical nature of the Font Software, and the current status of IT techniques, the Parties mutually agree that Production Systems SAS is subject to an obligation of means, specifically not guaranteeing that the Font Software is fit for the User's intended use.

The liability of Production Systems SAS may only be incurred by its actions and/or those of its employees in the case of acts carried out by it or them, within the framework of the execution of the License Agreement, and in the sole case where a causal link has been established between the alleged detriment and gross misconduct of Production Systems SAS and/or its employees, without prejudice to any applicable laws and regulations.

The User hereby accepts that the compensation for any loss suffered by the User arising from the use of the Font Software and/or concerning the execution of this License Agreement is limited to the amount of remuneration paid by the User to Production Systems SAS under Article 7 of this agreement, without prejudice to any applicable laws and regulations.

### 8.5 Liability

Production Systems SAS disavows any liability in any respect whatsoever for indirect damages such as loss of earnings, commercial or financial detriment, the increase of general costs, resulting from third-party claims or losses originating in or being the consequence of this License Agreement, even when Production Systems SAS has previously been informed, as well as damages caused to persons or property distinct from the contractual purpose, without prejudice toward any applicable laws and regulations.

The User alone shall bear the consequences of operating faults of the Font Software due to any use non-compliant with the operating instructions, and acknowledges that Production Systems SAS does not guarantee the Font Software is fit for the use sought by the User.

The User agrees that it bears the burden of complying with all laws, foreign and domestic, on the control of exports or transfers of technology.

If the User acquires the Font for governmental usage, the User agrees to read and comply with all applicable rules relating to the purchase of a license to use the software, and the effective use of same.

## ARTICLE 9 – CANCELLATION

### 9.1 Cancellation for breach of the User

In case of breach by the User of any of its obligations under the License Agreement, the latter may be canceled ex officio, without any legal formality, 30 (thirty) days after formal notice has gone unanswered. The cancellation must be notified by Production Systems SAS to the User by registered mail with notification of receipt.

The User is required to immediately withdraw documents printed on tangible formats published with the help of the Font Software, and including the Typeface, already made available to the public or distributed. The User may not use up existing stocks of such documents published but not yet distributed before the cancellation date. No re-publication nor reprint using the Font Software and/or Typeface is authorized after the cancellation date. The User shall also have the obligation to withdraw Font files from any intangible or digital formats (applications, servers, etc.) immediately.

### 9.2 Cancellation for convenience

The Parties may end the License Agreement at any time, respecting a notice period of 3 (three) months following the sending of a registered letter with notification of receipt.

In this case, the User is not required to proceed with withdrawal when documents printed on tangible formats published with the help of the Font Software and including Typographical Characters have already been made available to the public and/or distributed. The User is also authorized to use up existing stocks of such documents, published but not yet distributed, before the cancellation date. It is, on the other hand, understood between the Parties that no re-publication using the Font Software and/or Typeface is authorized after the cancellation date.

### 9.3 Consequences common to all types of cancellations

In the event of cancellation, it is agreed between the Parties that the User must immediately cease use of the Font Software to publish all documents and/or its use and/ or integration into any file and/or any software enabling the display of Typeface on all types of formats and/or terminal. 

In all cases, the User undertakes to delete the Font Software and, if he has made one, the back-up copy of the Font Software, from the Server, Computer and, more generally, any storage space in which the Font Software and/or the back-up copy of the Font Software is stored.

The User acknowledges that the conservation of the Font Software and/or the back-up copy of the Font Software after the cancellation of the License Agreement constitutes a breach for which the User may be subject to legal action.

The User undertakes to recall all multimedia files and/or products integrating the Typographical Characters and/or the Font Software, and making it possible to generate Typeface and, more generally, all copies of files and/or products integrating the Font Software within no more than thirty (30) days of the cancellation date of the License Agreement.

In case of cancellation of this agreement, the stipulations of Articles 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 13 remain applicable.

### ARTICLE 10 – ASSIGNMENT

10.1 The License Agreement is personal, and the User may not assign it or transfer it to a third party, without prejudice to the cases expressly set out in Article 3 herein, where the use of the Font Software by a third party is authorized, subject to respect for the conditions and purpose of this use.

It should be recalled, for all useful purposes, that if the User is a service provider and concludes a license for his own usage, this does not cover the use of the Font Software by any of the customers of the User, except in the cases expressly set out herein. As applicable, and if he so wishes, the User’s customer must acquire a license from Production Systems SAS.

10.2 In the event that the Font Software is validly assigned by the User to a third party pursuant to law, in all cases said assignment shall only be valid and enforceable against Production Systems SAS as long as the User informs Production System SAS of the identity and full details of the assignee of the Font Software, and the User provides evidence to Productions Systems SAS of the destruction of all copies of the Font Software held by the initial user.

10.3 Production Systems SAS may assign at any time the obligations springing from this License Agreement to the natural person or legal entity of its choice.

### ARTICLE 11 – NON-DISCLOSURE

The User is prohibited from revealing to any third party any information he may have accessed relating to the know-how and/or technologies employed by Production Systems SAS for the design and/or use of the Font Software.

This obligation survives the termination of this Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, for a period of 10 (ten) years, without prejudice toward the application of the intellectual property rights of Production Systems SAS to the Font Software.

### ARTICLE 12 – APPLICABLE LAW AND COMPETENT JURISDICTION

12.1 The Parties agree that the License Agreement is prepared, subject to and interpreted according to French law. The User expressly agrees that the United Nations Convention on Agreements for International Sales of Goods is hereby excluded.

12.2 Before any referral to the courts, the User undertakes to inform Production Systems SAS of any dispute, by letter sent by regular mail to Production Systems SAS, 255 rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine 75011 Paris, France, and to seek an amicable solution. In the event of failure to reach an amicable solution, the Parties agree that any dispute relating, in particular, to the validity, interpretation, and execution of the License Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent Paris courts, subject to mandatory laws and regulations.

### ARTICLE 13 – VARIOUS PROVISIONS

13.1 The License Agreement, its annexes, its amendments and the Purchase Orders indicating the total price of each order, as well as the detail of the Font Software programs selected, the license(s) selected and their duration, and the price of each license, constitute the entirety of the commitments made between the Parties, and annul and replace prior verbal and/or written commitments between the Parties on the same subject.

13.2 The License Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment validly accepted by the Parties.

13.3 Production Systems SAS reserves the right to amend or modify the License Agreement at any moment without notice, for future technical developments. The user may be informed by any means of the new stipulations of the License Agreement.

In case of modification of this License Agreement, the User shall be asked to accept the new License Agreement according to the same conditions as this agreement. When accepting the said modification, the User shall be asked to accept the new License Agreement by mandatorily "ticking" the box attesting to acceptance of the new License Agreement "I have read and fully accept all of the rules set out in this License". The modified License Agreement shall only be applicable to the User after they have expressly accepted it.

13.4 The fact of not requiring or forcing the execution by the User of certain stipulations herein, or the fact of not prevailing upon a right set out herein, cannot be interpreted as a waiver, by Production Systems SAS, of its right to require or impose the execution of these stipulations.

The express waiver by production Systems SAS of stipulations, conditions or requirements in this License Agreement may not constitute a waiver of any future obligation of compliance with said stipulations, conditions or requirements.

13.5 If one or several stipulations of the License Agreement are held to be invalid or declared as such pursuant to law, regulations or following a definitive ruling by a competent court, the other stipulations shall retain all their force and scope.

The Parties thus agree to replace the clause declared null and void with one that is as equivalent as possible to its content, and the economic intent of the clause initially agreed.

13.6 All requests for information must be sent by e-mail to: <info@productiontype.com>

Each Party agrees to inform the other Party of any substantial modification concerning its situation (particularly the address, bank details, assignments, etc.)

13.8 The User expressly acknowledges he has read and understood this License Agreement, and that in using the Font Software, he agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
